 0.5.0 -- ?? ??? 2005
----------------------

* Added a highpass filter on the receiver side to filter out incoming
  CTCSS tones.

* Now possible to specify custom activation/deactivation sounds for
  the repeater logic.

* The repeater logic now opens on squelch close rather than squelch
  open. This is so that the first announcement will not be missed
  by the opener.



 0.4.0 -- 25 Mar 2005
----------------------

* Bugfix: Crash when the parrot module was active and an echolink
  connection were coming in.

* Applied patch from Eric Jacobson: Only ident if the link has been
  transmitting. New config variable: IDENT_ONLY_AFTER_TX.

* Added roger beep for SimplexLogic.

* ModuleParrot: The TX hang bug might now have been fixed. I really hope so...

* ModuleEchoLink: Now not possible to initiate a connection to own node.

* ModuleEchoLink: Added a link idle timeout timer.

* ModuleEchoLink: Now reports the number of connected stations when an
  identification is manually triggered by a "*".

* Now announcing the CTCSS frequency at manual identification if
  REPORT_CTCSS is set.

* ModuleParrot bugfix: Leading zeros were skipped when reading back
  entered DTMF digits.

* ModuleEchoLink bugfix: Now and then right after a disconnection, the link
  was automagically reestablished. Incoming connections are now not allowed
  from the disconnected station for five seconds.

* Added a simple macro system to be able to assign short command strings
  to longer commands. See documentation for the MACROS section in the
  configuration file description.

* Now possible to use an external hardware squelch indicator via a
  serial port. Usable pins are CTS, DSR, DCD and RI.

* ModuleEchoLink: New command, "1", added. When giving this command,
  all connected stations callsigns will be read back.

* The Repeater logic is now nice and stable. However, there are some
  audio issues that need to be fixed. There is some noise after playing
  sound clips that is not nice to listen to. The cause for this may be
  Alsa OSS emulation problems. I'll switch to native Alsa to see if that
  might help. Also, some times (not very often) the repeated audio get
  chopped up.



 0.3.0 -- 26 Sep 2004
----------------------

* Added anti flutter to the DTMF detection code. The anti flutter code is
  activated by prefixing all DTMF commands with the "A" character. When the
  feature is activated, two or more of the same digit in a row are ignored.
  To input more than one of the same digit in a row, use the repetition
  character "B". To end the command, use the "C" character. The anti flutter
  code is only active for one command. That is, until "C" is received.
  Example: A112B3C = 1223, AC = empty command = #.

* Bugfix in the Parrot module: The module timeout timer kept running after
  the module had been manually deactivated. This caused svxlink to crash when
  the timeout occured.

* ModuleEchoLink: Added support for multiple echolink connections. Two new
  configuration variable was added to support this: MAX_CONNECTIONS and
  MAX_QSOS.

* ModuleEchoLink: Now sending an audio reject message if the connection
  was rejected.

* Added command line parsing and two command line switches. The first is the
  --daemon switch which make the SvxLink server run in the background.
  The second is --logfile which make it possible to redirect stdout and
  stderr to a file.

* ModuleEchoLink: Improved directory list handling.

* Bugfix: The TX would hang some times.

* Bugfix: Audio transmitted by modules had precendence over local messages
  which caused interrupted announcements.

* Bugfix: The TX timeout caused some problems.

* Added an option to execute DTMF commands at squelch close in addition to
  when # is pressed (XyzLogic/EXEC_CMD_ON_SQL_CLOSE). However, the DTMF
  decoder will probably have to be improved to not false trigger for this
  feature to be really useful.

* ModuleParrot: New configuration option REPEAT_DELAY that makes it possible
  to wait a while after the squelch closes before playing back the recorded
  message.



 0.2.0 -- 27 May 2004
----------------------

* A SvxLink server node can now act as a repeater system.

* Added periodic identification.

* Improved sound clips.

* Improved DTMF decoding algorithm.

* ModuleEchoLink: Now printing out incoming chat messages.

* ModuleEchoLink: Now only printing out incoming info messages if it
  differs from the last message received.

* CTCSS squelch implemented. Usage of this is recommended over using
  the vox squelch. Make sure that your receiver let the CTCSS frequencies
  through.

* Fixed the Parrot module so that the whole FIFO is played. Previously
  only 15 seconds was played.

* Now possible to set the length of the Parrot module FIFO in the config
  file. That is, it is now possible to set the maximum recording length.

* ModuleEchoLink: "Connecting to <callsign>" is now announced before
  actually connecting.



 0.1.1 -- 16 Apr 2004
----------------------

* Bugfix: Incoming connections wasn't properly taken care of in ModuleEchoLink.



 0.1.0 -- 04 Apr 2004
----------------------

* Initial revision

* New application: svxlink, a multi purpose voice services frontend.

* New module: A Help module for svxlink.

* New module: A Parrot module for svxlink that echos back everything you say.

* New module: An EchoLink module for svxlink to handle EchoLink connections.
