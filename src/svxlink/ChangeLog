 0.3.0 -- ?? Aug 2004
----------------------

* Added anti flutter to the DTMF detection code. The anti flutter code is
  activated by prefixing all DTMF commands with the "A" character. When the
  feature is activated, two or more of the same digit in a row are ignored.
  To input more than one of the same digit in a row, use the repetition
  character "B". To end the command, use the "C" character. The anti flutter
  code is only active for one command. That is, until "C" is received.
  Example: A112B3C = 1223, AC = empty command = #.

* Bugfix in the Parrot module: The module timeout timer kept running after
  the module had been manually deactivated. This caused svxlink to crash when
  the timeout occured.

* ModuleEchoLink: Added support for multiple echolink connections. Two new
  configuration variable was added to support this: MAX_CONNECTIONS and
  MAX_QSOS.

* ModuleEchoLink: Now sending an audio reject message if the connection
  was rejected.



 0.2.0 -- 27 May 2004
----------------------

* A SvxLink server node can now act as a repeater system.

* Added periodic identification.

* Improved sound clips.

* Improved DTMF decoding algorithm.

* ModuleEchoLink: Now printing out incoming chat messages.

* ModuleEchoLink: Now only printing out incoming info messages if it
  differs from the last message received.

* CTCSS squelch implemented. Usage of this is recommended over using
  the vox squelch. Make sure that your receiver let the CTCSS frequencies
  through.

* Fixed the Parrot module so that the whole FIFO is played. Previously
  only 15 seconds was played.

* Now possible to set the length of the Parrot module FIFO in the config
  file. That is, it is now possible to set the maximum recording length.

* ModuleEchoLink: "Connecting to <callsign>" is now announced before
  actually connecting.
