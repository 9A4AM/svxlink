 0.12.0 -- ?? ??? 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfixes for multi open of sound device.

* New method in AudioIO to clear all samples in the buffer.

* Bugfix: Handling flushing when already flushed correctly.

* Bugfix: CPU could go up to 100% when writing audio to the
  sound card.

* DNS lookups are now asynchronous (well, threaded anyway)
  so no more blocking DNS lookup calls.

* Start and end of sound playback is now amplitude shaped
  to not create noise at end of playback.

* Bugfix: Forgot to clean up everything when the disconnect
  method was called.

* Added an unequality operator to the Async::IpAddress class.



 0.11.0 -- 25 Mar 2005
-----------------------

* Added some code to AsyncTcpServer to broadcast data to connected
  clients. Contribution by SM0LCB / Ulf.

* Now possible to list all tags in a config section.

* The Serial class can now handle multiple users per port.

* Bugfix: The AudioIO class did not handle mutiple users correctly.



 0.10.0 -- 26 Sep 2004
----------------------

* Now the AudioIO object is really checking for full duplex capablility.

* Bugfix: The application would crash if the AudioIO object were deleted
  and then recreated.

* New class "Serial" for serial port usage.

* Bugfix: The DnsLookup class did not delete its DnsLookupWorker object
  and other memory handling was a mess as well. Thank you "valgrind"
  for helping me find this!



 0.9.0 -- 27 May 2004
----------------------

* Separate reader and writer in the same application can now open the audio
  device at the same time. The device is automatically set to full duplex
  operation. Previously, only one AudioIO object could have the device opened
  at a time.

* Added an environment variable that make it possible to disable the use
  of the trigger functionality when opening an audio device. This was necessary
  to make Alsa OSS emulation work. Set ASYNC_AUDIO_NOTRIGGER=1 to disable the
  use of the trigger functionality.

* Decreased the audio buffers in the audio device to make audio playback
  more responsive.



 0.8.0 -- 04 Apr 2004
----------------------

* Audio handling rewritten to handle a separate reader and writer within
  the same application.

* Split the async lib into core, cpp, qt and demo parts.

* Earlier log entries for the async library can be found in ../qtel/ChangeLog.
