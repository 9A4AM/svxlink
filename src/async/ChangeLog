 0.9.0 -- ?? May 2004
----------------------

* Separate reader and writer in the same application can now open the audio
  device at the same time. The device is automatically set to full duplex
  operation. Previously, only one AudioIO object could have the device opened
  at a time.

* Added an environment variable that make it possible to disable the use
  of the trigger functionality when opening an audio device. This was necessary
  to make Alsa OSS emulation work. Set ASYNC_AUDIO_NOTRIGGER to disable the
  use of the trigger functionality.



 0.8.0 -- 04 Apr 2004
----------------------

* Audio handling rewritten to handle a separate reader and writer within
  the same application.

* Split the async lib into core, cpp, qt and demo parts.

* Earlier log entries for the async library can be found in ../qtel/ChangeLog.
