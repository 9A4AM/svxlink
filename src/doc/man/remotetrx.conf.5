.TH REMOTETRX.CONF 5 "APRIL 2008" Linux "File Formats"
.
.SH NAME
.
remotetrx.conf \- Configuration file for the SvxLink remote transceiver server
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B remotetrx
is the SvxLink remote transceiver server. This man-page describe the
configuration file format for it.
.P
Remotetrx look for configuration files in a number of places. First it tries to
find a user specific configuration file. It will look for a user specific
configuration file in two places:
.BR $HOME/.svxlink/remotetrx.conf " or " $HOME/.remotetrxrc .
The latter is deprecated. Use the one that will best fit your need. If no user
specific configuration file can be found, remotetrx will look for the system
wide configuration file
.BR /etc/remotetrx.conf .
The
.B --config
command line option may also be used to specify an arbitrary configuration file.
.
.SH FILE FORMAT
.
The configuration file is in the famous INI-file format. A generic example of
how such a file might look like is shown below.

  [SECTION1]
  VALUE1=1
  VALUE2="TWO "
  VAULE3="Multi "
         "line"
  
  [SECTION2]
  VALUE1=2

This is a simple format that contain name=value pairs that belong to a section.
In written text, a specific configuration variable can be referred to as
SECTION1/VALUE2 meaning "configuration variable VALUE2 in section SECTION1".
.P
The same variable name can exist in two different sections. For example VALUE1
in section SECTION1 have the value 1 and VALUE1 in section SECTION2 have the
value 2. Values containing spaces at the beginning or end of the line must be
surrounded by citation characters (see SECTION1/VALUE2). Likewise with a multi
line value (see SECTION1/VALUE3).
.
.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
.
Here is the description of all configuration variables that remotetrx
understands. The configuration variables are described section for section.
.
.SS GLOBAL
.
The GLOBAL section contains application global configuration data.
.TP
.B RX
Point out the receiver configuration section to use. Set to NONE if no RX is
used. A receiver is configured in the exact same way as in the SvxLink server.
Have a look at
.BR svxlink.conf (5)
for more information on how to configure a receiver.
.TP
.B TX
Point out the transmitter configuration section to use. Set to NONE if no TX is
used. A transmitter is configured in the exact same way as in the SvxLink
server. Have a look at
.BR svxlink.conf (5)
for more information on how to configure a transmitter.
.TP
.B UPLINK
Point out the uplink configuration section to use. The uplink section specify
how this remote receiver should be linked to the main SvxLink server. Read more
about this in the "Network Uplink Section" or "TX Uplink Section" chapters
below.
.TP
.B CFG_DIR
Specify the path to a directory that contain additional configuration files.
If a relative path is specified, the path will be relative to the directory
where the main configuration file is at. All files in the specified directory
will be read as additional configuration. Filenames starting with a dot are
ignored.
.TP
.B TIMESTAMP_FORMAT
This variable specifies the format of the timestamp that is written in front of
each row in the log file. The format string is in the same format as specified
in the
.BR strftime (3)
manual page. The default is "%c" which is described as: "the preferred date and
time representation for the current locale". The environment variables LC_TIME,
LC_ALL and LANG will affect how this time format will look. For example, setting
LC_TIME="sv_SE.UTF8" will give you swedish timestamp representation. Other
examples of format specifiers are:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
.BR %d " - The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31)"
.IP \(bu 4
.BR %b " - The abbreviated month name according to the current locale"
.IP \(bu 4
.BR %Y " - The year as a decimal number including the century"
.IP \(bu 4
.BR %H " - The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23)"
.IP \(bu 4
.BR %M " - The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59)"
.IP \(bu 4
.BR %S " - The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61)"
.P
So, TIMESTAMP_FORMAT="%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S" would give a timestamp looking something like:
"29 Nov 2005 22:31:59".
.RE
.TP
.B CARD_SAMPLE_RATE
This configuration variable determines the sampling rate used for audio
input/output. SvxLink always work with a sampling rate of 8kHz internally but
there still are som benefits from using a higher sampling rate. On some sound
cards the filters look pretty bad at 8kHz and the amplitude response will not be
uniform which among other things can cause problems for the software DTMF
decoder.

Some sound cards also sound very bad at 8kHz due to insufficient
anti-alias filtering or resampling effects. These, often cheeper, sound cards
sound OK at 48kHz.

The downside of choosing a higher sampling rate is that it puts a little bit
more load on the CPU so if you have a very slow machine (<300MHz), it might not
have the computational power to handle it.

Supported sampling rates are: 8000, 16000 and 48000.
.
.SS Network uplink section
.
The network uplink section is used to specify the configuration for a network
link to the main SvxLink server. In the default configuration file there is a
network uplink section called
.BR NetUpLink .
The configuration is quite boring at the moment since there is only one
configuration variable and that variable can only have one value.
.TP
.B TYPE
Always "Net" for a networked uplink.
.
.SS TX uplink section
.
The TX uplink section is used to specify the configuration for a RF
link to the main SvxLink server. In the default configuration file there is a
TX uplink section called
.BR TxUpLink .
The section name could be anything. It should match the UPLINK configuration
variable in the GLOBAL section.
The use of TX uplinks is very EXPERIMENTAL and has not been tested in real life
yet. It is also very simplistic at the moment. It just retransmits what comes in
on the receiver. This can be used to link remote receivers coming in on the
Internet to a site that do not have access to Internet. At the moment, only
audio is relayed, no signal level information, receiver ID or other stuff like
detected DTMF digits, tones etc.
.TP
.B TYPE
Always "Tx" for a TX uplink.
.TP
.B TX
Point out the uplink transmitter configuration section to use. The configuration
for an uplink transmitter looks exactly the same as for any other transmitter.
In the default configuration file there is an uplink transmitter configuration
section called "UplinkTx".
.
.SH FILES
