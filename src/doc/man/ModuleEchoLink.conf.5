.TH MODULEECHOLINK.CONF 5 "APRIL 2006" Linux "File Formats"
.
.SH NAME
.
ModuleEchoLink.conf \- Configuration file for the SvxLink server EchoLink module
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B svxlink
is a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use. This man-page
describe the SvxLink server configuration for the EchoLink module.
.P
The EchoLink module is used to connect to other EchoLink stations.
.
.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
.
There are a couple of configuration variables that are common to all modules.
The documentation for these can be found in the
.BR svxlink.conf (5)
manual page.
.P
Here is the description of all module specific configuration
variables that the SvxLink EchoLink module understands.
.
.SS ModuleEchoLink
.
.TP
.B ALLOW_IP
Use this variable very carefully. Connections originating from the given subnet
will not be checked against the EchoLink directory server. A typical use of this
is if you want to connect to your own svxlink server and both the server and you
are behind a IP masquerading firewall. 
.TP
.B SERVER
The IP address or name of the EchoLink directory server to use. 
.TP
.B CALLSIGN
The callsign to use to login to the EchoLink directory server. 
.TP
.B SYSOPNAME
The name of the person or club that is responsible for this system. 
.TP
.B PASSWORD
The EchoLink directory server password to use. 
.TP
.B LOCATION
The location of the station. Note: In the default configuration file the value
of this configuration variable starts with "[Svx]". This is ofcource not
necessary but it's fun to see which other stations are running SvxLink. 
.TP
.B MAX_QSOS
The maximum number of stations that can participate in a conference QSO on this
node. If more stations try to connect, the connect request will be rejected. 
.TP
.B MAX_CONNECTIONS
When more stations than specified in MAX_QSOS try to connect, a connection will
temporarily be established long enough to play a message telling the remote
station that the connection was rejected. The connection is then immediately
terminated. If the number of connections exceeds MAX_CONNECTIONS, the connect
request is just ignored. This variable is typically set to MAX_QSOS+1 or more if
using a large number for MAX_QSOS. 
.TP
.B LINK_IDLE_TIMEOUT
The number of seconds that a connection is idle before disconnection will occur.
This is to prevent a link to stay open if someone forget to disconnect. Disable
this feature by setting this config variable to zero (or comment it out). 
.TP
.B DESCRIPTION
A longer description that is sent to remote stations upon connection. This
description should typically include detailed station information like QTH,
transceiver frequency/power, antenna, CTCSS tone frequency etc.
.
.SH FILES
.
.TP
.I /etc/svxlink.conf
The system wide configuration file.
.TP

variable setting.
