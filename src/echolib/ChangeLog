 0.10.1 -- ?? ??? 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfix: There was no timeout on commands sent to the directory server.
  This caused hanging connections when the directory server did not
  answer properly. The timeout is now two minutes.

* Bugfix: The callsign was not converted to upper case in
  EchoLink::Directory::setLocalCallsign as it should.

* Now converting the callsign to upper case i EchoLink::Qso::setCallsign.



 0.10.0 -- 25 Mar 2005
----------------------

* Fixed a compilation error which occured with newer compilers. The
  declaration of class Qso::GsmVoicePacket was not standards compliant.

* Fixed a memory leak. The GSM codec instance was not destroyed when the
  Qso object was destroyed.

* Instead of crashing (assert) when the registration of a connection fails
  we now return an error.

* Added getters for localCallsign, localName and localInfo.



 0.9.0 -- 26 Sep 2004
----------------------

* Bugfix: Server messages was not handled correctly.

* Fixed a strange error message.

* The getCalls method now emits the error signal when the status is not
  ONLINE or BUSY.

* Added the possibility to send and receive raw GSM audio packets. This is
  good for forwarding audio in for example a conference node.

* Bugfix: The wanted directory status was used in some places where the
  current directory status (the true status) should be used.



 0.8.0 -- 27 May 2004
----------------------

* Now able to use an unmodified GSM library include file.

* New method: isRemoteInitiated.

* Made the RX indicator a bit snappier.



 0.7.2 -- 04 Apr 2004
----------------------

* Look for earlier ChangeLog entries in ../qtel/ChangeLog.

* Adapted for changes in the async library.
