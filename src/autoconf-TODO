* Requires Qt but it should be possible to compile SvxLink without Qt.

* Does not require libgsm. Configure checks for it but is not aborted if
  not found.

* Does not properly handle the Speex dependency. Even if not found during
  the configure run, compilation is tried causing an error.

* Warning while compiling fidlib:

  CC     fidlib.lo
fidlib.c:28:0: warning: "VERSION" redefined
<command-line>:0:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition

* Does not require libpopt. If not present causes a compilation error.

* Does not require tcl-dev. If not present causes a compilation error.

* Does not require pdflatex but errors out if it does not exist. But even
  if it does exist, qteluserdoc.pdf is not built. Building the PDF docs
  should be optional.

* The compressed manual pages are not built.

* The qtel language translations are not built.

* The async demo, echolib_test and EchoLinkQso_demo binaries should not
  be installed. Only svxlink, remotetrx, siglevdetcal and qtel.

* Only include files for Async and EchoLib need to be installed. That is
  all Async*.h and EchoLib*.h. The other ones are internal.

* liblocationinfo and libtrx is internal libraries and should not be
  installed. Binaries should be statically linked to these libs.

* The *.la files should not be installed for the SvxLink plugins.

* Uncompressed manual pages are installed instead of compressed ones.

* The events.tcl file and the events.d and modules.d directories should
  be in <prefix>/share/svxlink/.

* The spool directory is placed directly under <prefix> instead of being
  placed in <localstatedir> (Usually /var).

* Missing directories: spool/svxlink/propagation_monitor/{vhfdx,dxrobot}.
