* Mechanism to support source based distributions like Gentoo.

* The SONAME is wrong for libraries. If the version for example is 0.18.4, the 
SONAME should be libname.so.0.18. You may rename the file to the same naming 
scheme if you want so that the file is called libname.so.0.18.4.

* Doxygen is no longer working since the h-files are no longer collected in a 
single include directory. Do we have to specify each file in the doxygen config 
INPUT config variable?  Or can we read out from somewhere which h-files that
are going to be installed?  Or should we generate the doxygen config files
from autoconf?

* The configure script fails on Fedora 14 since TCL is version 8.5. SvxLink 
work with both 8.4 and 8.5. Autoconf is version 2.66.

  checking for library containing Tcl_CreateCommand... no
  configure: error: Tcl_CreateCommand() is required (presumably in libtcl8.4)

* For CentOS 5, autoconf seem to be too old (2.59). It produced the
following output:

  $ autoreconf --install --force
  aclocal:configure.ac:15: warning: macro `AM_SILENT_RULES' not found in 
library
  aclocal:configure.ac:23: warning: macro `AM_COND_IF' not found in library
  aclocal:configure.ac:160: warning: macro `AM_COND_IF' not found in library
  aclocal:configure.ac:276: warning: macro `AM_COND_IF' not found in library
  configure.ac:4: error: Autoconf version 2.67 or higher is required
  configure.ac:4: the top level
  autom4te: /usr/bin/m4 failed with exit status: 63
  aclocal: autom4te failed with exit status: 63
  autoreconf: aclocal failed with exit status: 63

  CentOS 6 have been released now so I guess I can upgrade but it would be 
  nice if we could get it working on CentOS 5 as well if it's not too hard.
