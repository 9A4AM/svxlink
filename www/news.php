    The project has now been registered at
    <A href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/svxlink/">SourceForge</A>.
    I will start moving everything over there as soon as I have figured
    out how everything works.

  <TR><TD>
    I saw that this site has now appeared in the Google search engine.
    I guess people will start finding this page then. I have not made
    any announcements yet because of a problem I encountered. The problem
    is with audio boards/OSS drivers that does not support playing sounds in
    mono. I have made a fix so that it should work in stereo mode as well.
    However, when I tested this the mic gain was _very_ high. I could not
    make it work properly. I have probably made something really stupid but
    I can't figure out what. Please tell me if you know.
