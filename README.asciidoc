SvxLink
=======

SvxLink is a project that develops software targeting the ham radio community.
It started out as an EchoLink application for Linux back in 2003 but have now
evolved to be something much more advanced.

== SvxLink Server ==
The SvxLink Server is a general purpose voice services system, which when
connected to a transceiver, can act as both an advanced repeater system and can
also operate on a simplex channel. One could call it a radio operating system.

SvxLink is very extensible and modular. Voice services are implemented as
modules which are isolated from each other.  Modules can be implemented in
either C++ or TCL. Examples of modules are:

* *Help*               -- A help system
* *Parrot*             -- Play back everything that is received
* *EchoLink*           -- Connect to other EchoLink stations
* *DtmfRepeater*       -- Repeater received DTMF digits
* *TclVoiceMail*       -- Send voice mail to other local users
* *PropagationMonitor* -- Announce propagation warnings from dxmaps.com
* *SelCall*            -- Send selective calling sequences by entering DTMF codes
* *MetarInformation*   -- Play airport weather informatoion

== Qtel ==
Qtel, the Qt EchoLink client, is a graphical application used to access the
EchoLink network.
