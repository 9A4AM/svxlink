{"name":"Svxlink","tagline":"Advanced repeater controller and EchoLink software for Linux including a GUI, Qtel - The Qt EchoLink client","body":"## The Project\r\nSvxLink is a project that develops software targeting the ham radio community.\r\nIt started out as an EchoLink application for Linux back in 2003 but have now\r\nevolved to be something much more advanced.\r\n\r\n## SvxLink Server\r\nThe SvxLink Server is a general purpose voice services system, which when\r\nconnected to a transceiver, can act as both an advanced repeater system and can\r\nalso operate on a simplex channel. One could call it a radio operating system.\r\n\r\nSvxLink is very extensible and modular. Voice services are implemented as\r\nmodules which are isolated from each other.  Modules can be implemented in\r\neither C++ or TCL. Examples of modules are:\r\n\r\n * Help               -- A help system\r\n * Parrot             -- Play back everything that is received\r\n * EchoLink           -- Connect to other EchoLink stations\r\n * DtmfRepeater       -- Repeater received DTMF digits\r\n * TclVoiceMail       -- Send voice mail to other local users\r\n * PropagationMonitor -- Announce propagation warnings from dxmaps.com\r\n * SelCall            -- Send selective calling sequences by entering DTMF codes\r\n\r\n## Qtel\r\nQtel, the Qt EchoLink client, is a graphical application used to access the\r\nEchoLink network.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\nThese are some of the resources connected to SvxLink:\r\n\r\n * [GitHub Main Page](https://github.com/sm0svx/svxlink) -- The main project site\r\n * [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/sm0svx/svxlink/wiki) -- The SvxLink wiki pages\r\n * [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sm0svx/svxlink/issues) -- Report bugs and feature requests\r\n * [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/sm0svx/svxlink/releases) -- Download source code here\r\n * [The SvxLink SourcForge Site](http://svxlink.sourceforge.net/) -- Old project site\r\n * [Downloads](http://sourceforge.net/projects/svxlink/files/sounds) -- Download sound files for SvxLink Server from here\r\n * [Mailing Lists](http://sourceforge.net/p/svxlink/mailman) -- Communicate with other SvxLink users\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
