<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">svxlink.conf
&minus; Configuration file for the SvxLink server</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>svxlink</b>
is a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use.
This man-page describe the SvxLink server configuration file
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SvxLink look
for configuration files in a number of places. First it try
to find a user specific configuration file. SvxLink will
look for a user specific configuration file in:
<b>$HOME/.svxlink/svxlink.conf</b>. If no user specific
configuration file can be found, SvxLink will look for the
system wide configuration file
<b>/etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf</b>. The <b>--config</b>
command line option may also be used to specify an arbitrary
configuration file.</p>

<h2>FILE FORMAT
<a name="FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration file is in the famous INI-file format. A
generic example of how such a file might look like is shown
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[SECTION1] <br>
VALUE1=1 <br>
VALUE2=&quot;TWO &quot; <br>
VAULE3=&quot;Multi &quot; <br>
&quot;line&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[SECTION2] <br>
VALUE1=2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
simple format that contain name=value pairs that belong to a
section. In written text, a specific configuration variable
can be referred to as SECTION1/VALUE2 meaning
&quot;configuration variable VALUE2 in section
SECTION1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same
variable name can exist in two different sections. For
example VALUE1 in section SECTION1 have the value 1 and
VALUE1 in section SECTION2 have the value 2. Values
containing spaces at the beginning or end of the line must
be surrounded by citation characters (see SECTION1/VALUE2).
Likewise with a multi line value (see SECTION1/VALUE3).</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
<a name="CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is the
description of all configuration variables that SvxLink
understands. The configuration variables are described
section for section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GLOBAL</b>
<br>
The GLOBAL section contains application global configuration
data. <b><br>
MODULE_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify where the SvxLink
modules can be found. If MODULE_PATH is not specified, the
standard search paths for library files will be used. If
that also fails a hardcoded default will be used. What that
default is depend on the architecture but typically on a
x86_64 system it is /usr/lib64/svxlink. Leaving this
variable unset should work in most cases.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>LOGICS</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Specify a comma separated list of logic cores that
should be created. The logic core is the thing that ties the
transceiver and the voice services (modules) together. It
contains the rules for how the radio interface should be
handled. The specified name of a logic core must have a
corresponding section specified in the config file. This is
where the behaviour of the logic core is specified.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CFG_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the path to a directory
that contain additional configuration files. If a relative
path is specified, the path will be relative to the
directory where the main configuration file is at. All files
in the specified directory will be read as additional
configuration. Filenames starting with a dot (hidden files)
or not ending in .conf are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TIMESTAMP_FORMAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable specifies the
format of the timestamp that is written in front of each row
in the log file. The format string is in the same format as
specified in the <b>strftime</b>(3) manual page. The default
is &quot;%c&quot; which is described as: &quot;the preferred
date and time representation for the current locale&quot;.
The environment variables LC_TIME, LC_ALL and LANG will
affect how this time format will look. For example, setting
LC_TIME=&quot;sv_SE.UTF8&quot; will give you swedish
timestamp representation. Other examples of format
specifiers are:</p>

<p><b>%f</b> - Fractional seconds in millisecond resolution
(000-999)</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The last one
(%f) is a SvxLink specific formatting specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
TIMESTAMP_FORMAT=&quot;%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S.%f&quot; would give
a timestamp looking something like: &quot;29 Nov 2005
22:31:59.875&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CARD_SAMPLE_RATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable
determines the sampling rate used for audio input/output.
SvxLink always work with a sampling rate of 16kHz internally
but there still are som benefits from using a higher
sampling rate. On some sound cards the filters look pretty
bad at 16kHz and the amplitude response will not be uniform
which among other things can cause problems for the software
DTMF decoder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Some sound
cards also sound very bad at 16kHz due to insufficient
anti-alias filtering or resampling effects. These, often
cheeper, sound cards sound OK at 48kHz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The downside of
choosing a higher sampling rate is that it puts a little bit
more load on the CPU so if you have a very slow machine
(&lt;300MHz), it might not have the computational power to
handle it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Supported
sampling rates are: 16000 and 48000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CARD_CHANNELS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to specify how many channels to use when opening a sound
card. For normal sound cards the only practical values to
use are 1 for mono and 2 for stereo. The latter is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
sound card in stereo mode it is possible to use the left and
right channels independenly to drive two transceivers. When
using the sound card in mono mode, both left and right
channels transmit/receive the same audio.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LOCATION_INFO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enter the section name that
contains information required for transferring positioning
data to location servers. Setting this item makes the system
visible on the EchoLink link status page and the APRS
network.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Common Logic
configuration variables</b> <br>
A logic core is what define how SvxLink should behave on the
RF channel. The SvxLink server can handle more than one
logic core and so can be connected to more than one
transceiver. The configuration variables below are common to
all logic types. Configuration variables that are specific
to a certain logic core type are described below in a
section of its own.</p>

done in the specified configuration section.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MODULES</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a comma separated list
of configuration sections for the modules to load. This
tells SvxLink which modules to actually load on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CALLSIGN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the callsign that
should be announced on the radio interface.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of minutes between
short identifications. The purpose of the short
identification is to just announce that the station is on
the air. Typically just the callsign is transmitted. For a
repeater a good value is ten minutes and for a simplex node
one time every 60 minutes is probably enough. The
LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL must be an even multiple of the
SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL so if LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL is 60 then
the legal values for SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL are: 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. If unset or set to 0, disable
short identifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of minutes between
long identifications. The purpose of the long identification
is to transmit some more information about the station
status (new voice mails etc). The time of day is also
transmitted. A good value here is 60 minutes. If unset or
set to 0, disable long identifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>IDENT_ONLY_AFTER_TX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This feature controls when
identification is done. By default, identification is done
every time the SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL expires. If this feature
is enabled, identification will be done only if there has
been a recent transmission. This feature is good for nodes
using an RF link to provide echolink to a repeater. Often,
in this situation, it is not desirable for the link to
identify unless legally necessary. Note that
SHORT_IDENT_INTERVAL still have to be set for this feature
to work. That config variable will then be interpreted as
the minimum number of seconds between identifications. The
LONG_IDENT_INTERVAL will not be affected by this
parameter.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>EXEC_CMD_ON_SQL_CLOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a time, in
milliseconds, after squelch close after which entered DTMF
digits will be executed as a command without the need to
send the # character. To disable this feature, either
comment out the configuration row or set it to a value less
or equal to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>EVENT_HANDLER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Point out the TCL event handler
script to use. The TCL event handler script is responsible
for playing the correct audio clips when an event occurr.
The default location is /usr/share/svxlink/events.tcl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DEFAULT_LANG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the default language to use
for announcements. It should be set to an ISO code (e.g.
sv_SE for Swedish). If not set, it defaults to en_US which
is US English.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RGR_SOUND_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of milliseconds to
wait after the squelch has been closed before a roger beep
is played. The beep can be disabled by specifying a value of
&minus;1 or commenting out this line. Often it is best to
use the SQL_HANGTIME receiver configuration variable to
specify a delay instead of specifying a delay here. This
configuration variable should then be set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>REPORT_CTCSS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, will report the
specified CTCSS frequency upon manual identification (*
pressed). It is possible to specify fractions using
&quot;.&quot; as decimal comma. Disable this feature by
commenting out (#) this configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TX_CTCSS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable
controls if a CTCSS tone should be transmitted. Use a comma
separated list (no spaces!) to specify when to transmit a
CTCSS tone. These are the possible values: <b>SQL_OPEN</b>,
<b>LOGIC</b>, <b>MODULE</b>, <b>ANNOUNCEMENT</b> or
<b>ALWAYS</b>. Commenting out this configuration variable
will disable CTCSS transmit. The tone frequency and level is
configured in the transmitter configuration section.</p>

</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Point out a
section that contains the macros that should be used by this
logic core. See the section description for macros below for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FX_GAIN_NORMAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The gain (dB) to use for audio
effects and announcements when there is no other traffic.
This gain is normally set to 0dB which means no gain or
attenuation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FX_GAIN_LOW</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The gain (dB) to use for audio
effects and announcements when there is other traffic. This
gain is normally set to something like &minus;12dB so that
announcements and audio effects are attenuated when there is
other traffic present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>QSO_RECORDER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The QSO recorder is used to
write all received audio to files on disk. The format for
this configuration variable is &lt;command&gt;:&lt;config
section&gt;. The specified command is used to activate or
deactivate the QSO recorder. If the command for example is
set to 8, 81 will activate the recorder and 80 will
deactivate it. The command may also be left out. It will
then not be possible to control the QSO recorder using DTMF
commands. Even if the command is left out the colon must
always be specified. The config section point out a section
in the configuration file that holds configuration for the
QSO recorder. Have a look at the QSO Recorder Section
documentation for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
QSO_RECORDER=8:QsoRecorder</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SEL5_MACRO_RANGE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define two comma separated
values here to map the Sel5 tone call to your macro area.
E.g. if you have defined: SEL5_MACRO_RANGE=03400,03499 then
all incoming Sel5 tone sequences from 03400 to 03499 are
mapped to the macros section (refer to Macros Section, next
chapter). Other sequences but the one defined under
OPEN_ON_SEL5 are ignored so it can be used to call other
stations via the repeater without a repeater reaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ONLINE_CMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define a DTMF command that is
used to switch the node between online and offline mode.
When in the off-state, the transmitter will not be turned on
by any event. If a module is active when the node is brought
offline, it will be deactivated and no module activation
will be allowed in offline mode. No other commands than the
online command will be accepted in the offline state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the command
for example is set to 998877 then 9988771 will set the node
online and 9988770 will set it offline. If a module is
active or if the ACTIVATE_MODULE_ON_LONG_CMD is used, the
command must be prefixed with a star to work as expected.
The star means &quot;force core command&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>STATE_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Using this configuration
variable it is possible to specify a path to a UNIX 98 PTY
that SvxLink state events is published to. The published
events is in a simple text format using a space separated
list of values. SvxLink will create a softlink to the actual
slave PTY. For that reason, SvxLink must have write
permissions in the directory where the softlink should be
created. Monitoring the PTY output is as simple as doing a
<b>cat /path/to/pty</b> after starting SvxLink. See STATE
PTY FORMAT for more information on the format of the state
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
STATE_PTY=/tmp/state_pty</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_CTRL_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Using this configuration
variable it is possible to specify a path to a UNIX 98 PTY
that allows a dtmf control of each single SvxLink logic.
SvxLink will create a softlink to the actual slave PTY. For
that reason, SvxLink must have write permissions in the
directory where the softlink should be created. Sending
commands to the PTY is as simple as doing a <b>echo
&rsquo;*1#&rsquo; &gt; /path/to/pty</b> after starting
SvxLink. The device works bidirectional, received dtmf
characters (from Rf) are output via this interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
DTMF_CTRL_PTY=/dev/shm/dtmf_ctrl</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Simplex
Logic Section</b> <br>
The Simplex Logic section contains configuration data for a
simplex logic core. The name of the section, which in the
example configuration file is <b>SimplexLogic</b>, must have
a corresponding list item in the GLOBAL/LOGICS config
variable for this logic core to be activated. The name
&quot;SimplexLogic&quot; is not magic. It could be called
what ever you like but it must match the namespace name in
the SimplexLogic.tcl script. The configuration variables
below are those that are specific for a simplex logic
core.</p>

<b>Simplex</b>.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MUTE_RX_ON_TX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 1 to mute the receiver
when the transmitter is transmitting (default) or set it to
0 to make the RX active during transmissions. One might want
to set this to 0 if the link is operating on a split
frequency. Then the link can accept commands even when
it&rsquo;s transmitting. The normal setting is 1, to mute
the RX when transmitting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MUTE_TX_ON_RX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 1 to mute the
transmitter when the squelch is open (default) or set it to
0 to make the TX active during squelch open. One might want
to set this to 0 if the link is operating on a split
frequency or if it&rsquo;s connected to some full duplex
device. The normal setting is 1, to mute the TX when the
squelch is open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Repeater
Logic Section</b> <br>
A Repeater Logic section contains configuration data for a
repeater logic core. The name of the section, which in the
example configuration file is <b>RepeaterLogic</b>, must
have a corresponding list item in the GLOBAL/LOGICS config
variable for this logic core to be activated. The name
&quot;RepeaterLogic&quot; is not magic. It could be called
what ever you like but it must match the namespace name in
the RepeaterLogic.tcl script. The configuration variables
below are those that are specific for a repeater logic
core.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>NO_REPEAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set this to 1 if you do NOT
want SvxLink to play back the incoming audio. This can be
used when the received audio is directly coupled by hardware
wiring to the transmitter. What you win by doing this is
that there is zero delay on the repeated audio. When the
audio is routed through SvxLink there is always an amount of
delay. What you loose by doing this is the audio processing
done by SvxLink (e.g. filtering, DTMF muting, squelch tail
elimination) and the ability to use remote receivers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>IDLE_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of seconds the
repeater should have been idle before turning the
transmitter off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPEN_ON_1750</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater with a 1750Hz
tone burst. Specify the number of milliseconds the tone must
be asserted before the repeater is opened. Make sure that
the time specified is long enough for the squelch to have
time to open. Otherwise the repeater will open &quot;too
soon&quot; and you will hear an ugly 1750Hz beep as the
first thing. A value of 0 will disable 1750 Hz repeater
opening.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPEN_ON_CTCSS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater with a CTCSS
tone (PL). The syntax of the value is tone_fq:min_length.
The tone frequency is specified in whole Hz and the minimum
tone length is specified in milliseconds. For examples if a
136.5 Hz tone must be asserted for two seconds for the
repeater to open, the value 136:2000 should be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPEN_ON_DTMF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater with a DTMF
digit. Only one digit can be specified. DTMF digits pressed
when the repeater is down will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPEN_ON_SEL5</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
if you want to open your repeater by using a selective tone
call that is often used in commercial radio networks.
Example: OPEN_ON_SEL5=03345 opens your repeater only if that
sequence has been received. You can use sequence lengths
from 4 to 25.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CLOSE_ON_SEL5</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
if you want to close your repeater by using a selective tone
call that is often used in commercial radio networks.
Example: CLOSE_ON_SEL5=03345 closes your repeater if that
sequence has been received. You can use sequence lengths
from 4 to 25.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPEN_ON_SQL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
if it should be possible to open the repeater just by
keeping the squelch open for a while. The value to set is
the minimum number of milliseconds the squelch must be open
for the repeater to open.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPEN_ON_SQL_AFTER_RPT_CLOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Activate the repeater on just a
squelch opening if there have been no more than the
specified number of seconds since the repeater closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPEN_SQL_FLANK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Determines if OPEN_ON_SQL and
OPEN_ON_CTCSS should activate the repeater when the squelch
open or close. If set to OPEN, the repeater will activate
and start retransmitting audio immediately. No
identification will be sent. If set to CLOSE, the repeater
will not activate until the squelch close. An identification
will be sent in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>IDLE_SOUND_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When the repeater is idle, a
sound is played. Specify the interval in milliseconds
between playing the idle sound. An interval of 0 disables
the idle sound.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_FLAP_SUP_MIN_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Flapping squelch suppression is
used to close the repeater down if there is interference on
the frequency that open the squelch by short bursts. This
configuration variable is used to specify the minimum time,
in milliseconds, that a transmission must last to be
classified as a real transmission. A good value is in
between 500-2000ms.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_FLAP_SUP_MAX_COUNT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Flapping squelch suppression is
used to close the repeater down if there is interference on
the frequency that open the squelch by short bursts. This
configuration variable is used to specify the maximum number
of consecutive short squelch openings allowed before
shutting the repeater down. A good value is in between
5-10.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ACTIVATE_MODULE_ON_LONG_CMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable
activate a feature that might help users not aware of the
SvxLink command structure. The idea is to activate the
specified module when a long enough command has been
received. The typical example is an EchoLink user that is
used to just typing in the node ID and then the connection
should be established right away. Using this configuration
variable, specify a minimum length and a module name. If no
module is active and at least the specified number of digits
has been entered, the given module is activated and the
command is sent to it. To be really useful this feature
should be used in cooperation with
EXEC_CMD_ON_SQL_CLOSE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
this configuration variable is set to &quot;4:EchoLink&quot;
and the user types in 9999, the EchoLink module is first
activated and then the command 9999 is sent to it, which
will connect to the ECHOTEST server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>IDENT_NAG_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tell repeater users that are
not identifying to identify themselvs. The number of seconds
to wait for an identification, after the repeater has been
activated, is set using this configuration variable. A valid
identification is considered to be a transmission longer
than the time set by the IDENT_NAG_MIN_TIME configuration
variable. We don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s really an
identification but it&rsquo;s the best we can do. Setting it
to 0 or commenting it out disables the feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>IDENT_NAG_MIN_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the minimum time, in
milliseconds, that a transmission must last to be considered
as an identification. This is used as described in the
IDENT_NAG_TIMEOUT configuration variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ReflectorLogic</b>
<br>
The ReflectorLogic is used to connect to an SvxReflector
server. The SvxReflector will distribute all audio to all
connected nodes. To actually send audio to the reflector
from a logic core, set up a link between the two logics
using LogicLinking. More than one logic core can be
connected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CALLSIGN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The callsign of this node. The
callsign also serves as the username when authenticating to
the SvxReflector server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AUTH_KEY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The authentication key, or
password, used when authenticating to the SvxReflector
server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>JITTER_BUFFER_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A jitter buffer is used to
prevent gaps in the audio when the network connection do not
provide a steady flow of data. Set this configuration
variable to the number of milliseconds to buffer before
starting to process the audio. Default: 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>QSO Recorder
Section</b> <br>
The QSO recorder is used to record all received audio to
files on disk. All audio from receivers, modules and logic
links are recorded. Announcements are not recorded. <b><br>
REC_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to specify in which directory to write the audio files. A
good place is /var/spool/svxlink/qso_recorder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MIN_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the duration of the recorded
content for a file is less then MIN_TIME milliseconds, the
file will be deleted when the file is closed. Default: 0
(empty files will be deleted).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAX_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Setting this configuration
variable will set an upper limit for the file size of a
recording. No more than MAX_TIME seconds of content will be
recorded to a single file. When the maximum time have been
reached, the file is closed and another file is created.
Note that it is not the maximum time that the recording has
been active that we are setting a limit for but rather how
much content that have been recorded to the file. If nothing
is recorded, the file can stay open indefinitely. Default: 0
(no limit)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SOFT_TIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To not get abrupt breaks in
recordings it is possible to set a soft break time.
Let&rsquo;s say that MAX_TIME is set to 3600 seconds (one
hour). If we set SOFT_TIME to 300 seconds (five minutes) the
QSO recorder try to close the file on a squelch close
somewhere between 55 and 60 minutes. In this way we may
avoid getting transmissions split up between files. Default:
0 (no limit)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MAX_DIRSIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the maximum total size
in megabytes of the files in the recording directory. If the
limit is exceeded, the oldest files are deleted. The
directory size is checked upon file close so the size may
grow temporarily past the limit with at most the size of one
recorded file. Only files which have a filename starting
with &quot;qsorec_&quot; will be considered for deletion. If
using an ENCODING_CMD, make sure that the
&quot;qsorec_&quot; prefix is not removed from the target
filename unless you really want the MAX_DIRSIZE feature to
skip them. Default: 0 (no limit)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DEFAULT_ACTIVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this configuration variable
is set to 1, the QSO recorder will be activated by default
when SvxLink start. Default: 0 (default inactive)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a timeout is specified, the
activation state of the QSO recorder will return to the
value specified in the DEFAULT_ACTIVE configuration variable
when the node has been idle for the specified number of
seconds. When DEFAULT_ACTIVE is unset or 0, if the QSO
recorder is manually activated it will be automatically
deactivated after the specified amount of time of
inactivity. When DEFAULT_ACTIVE is set to 1, if the QSO
recorder is manually deactivated it will be automatically
activated after the specified amount of time of inactivity.
Default: 0 (no timeout)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>QSO_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set this configuration variable
if you want to close the currently opened file and open a
new one after each QSO. The number of seconds the node
should be idle before closing the file should be specified.
Default: 0 (no QSO timeout)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ENCODER_CMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a command to be
executed after a new wav file have been written to disk.
This makes it possible to use an external encoder utility to
encode the wav file to another format. Even though this
configuration variable was added to run an external encoder
it could do more complicated things with the file if needed.
A couple of examples would be to transfer the file to
another computer or to send a notification e-mail. If the
command line get too complicated it may be a good idea to
write a script instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The encoder
command will be run under a shell so normal shell operators
like redirects and pipes may be used. The shell specified in
the SHELL environment variable will be used and if not set,
/bin/sh will be used. The &quot;&minus;c&quot; command line
option will be added so the complete command will look
something like: $SHELL &minus;c &quot;$ENCODER_CMD&quot;. A
number of %-codes can be included in the command. They have
the following meaning:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The encoder
will be started in the background and it will not be stopped
even if SvxLink exits. It will run in the background until
it&rsquo;s done. As long as SvxLink is running it is
monitoring the encoding processes. If a process run for
longer than one hour it will be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
SvxLink will never remove the original recording so that
have to be done in the encoder command. Here are a couple of
examples:</p>

\&quot;%f\&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Macros
Section</b> <br>
A macros section is used to declare macros that can be used
by a logic core. The logic core points out the macros
section to use by using the MACROS configuration variable.
The name of the MACROS section can be chosen arbitrarily as
long as it match the MACROS configuration variable in the
logic core configuration section. There could for example
exist both a [RepeaterLogicMacros] and a
[SimplexLogicMacros] section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A macro is a
kind of shortcut that can be used to decrease the amount of
key presses that have to be done to connect to common
EchoLink stations for example. On the radio side, macros are
activated by pressing &quot;D&quot; &quot;macro number&quot;
&quot;#&quot;. A macros section can look something like the
example below. Note that the module name is case
sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[Macros] <br>
1=EchoLink:9999# <br>
2=EchoLink:1234567# <br>
9=Parrot:0123456789#</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
pressing DTMF sequence &quot;D1#&quot; will activate the
EchoLink module and connect to the EchoTest conference
node.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Logic
Linking</b> <br>
A logic linking configuration section is used to specify
information for a link between two or more SvxLink logic
cores. Such a link can for example be used to connect a
local repeater to a remote repeater using a separate link
transceiver. The link is activated/deactivated using DTMF
commands and/or automatically depending on your
configuration. When the link is active, all audio received
by one logic will be transmitted by the other logic(s).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name of the
logic linking section can be chosen freely. In the example
configuration file, there is a section [LinkToR4]. To use a
logic linking section in a logic core it must be pointed out
by the LINKS configuration variable in the GLOBAL section.
Example: GLOBAL/LINKS=LinkToR4 <b><br>
CONNECT_LOGICS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A comma separated list of logic
specifications for the logic cores to connect together. Each
logic specification has three parts separated by colons:
&lt;logic name&gt;:&lt;command&gt;:&lt;announcement
name&gt;. The &quot;logic name&quot; is the name of the
logic to include in the link. To manually activate or
deactivate the link from the just specified logic,
&quot;command&quot; is used. The &quot;announcement
name&quot; is used when announcing link related activities
like activation or deactivation. Both &quot;command&quot;
and &quot;announcement name&quot; may be left empty if no
manual control is wanted. An example config line may look
like this:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">RepeaterLogic_2m:99:SK3GW,RepeaterLogic_70cm:94:SK3GK</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">It will include
two logics in the link, RepeaterLogic_2m and
RepeaterLogic_70cm. From the 2m side, the link will be
activated when the user send command 991 and deactivated
when the user send command 990. Upon activation, an
announcement like &quot;activating link to SK3GW&quot; will
be played back. From the 70cm side the command will be 941
and 940 respectively. The announcement when activating the
link from the 70cm side will be something like
&quot;activating link to SK3GK&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DEFAULT_ACTIVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The link will be connected
automatically during startup of SvxLink if this
configuration variable is set to 1. Also, if a link is
manually disconnected by a user it will be automatically
reconnected after some time of inactivity. The time is
specified by setting the TIMEOUT configuration variable. If
the TIMEOUT variable is not set, no automatic reactivation
will be done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of seconds after
which the link will be automatically deactivated if there
have been no activity. If 1 have been specified for
DEFAULT_ACTIVE, this configuration variable will specify
after how many seconds the link will be reactivated after
being manually deactivated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AUTOACTIVATE_ON_SQL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enter a comma separated list of
logics, which should automatically activate the link if
there is activity (e.g. squelch open) in it. One possible
application for this is for example to make the connection
of a microphone/speaker combination (without DTMF encoder)
for brief announcements but without having to constantly
listen in. Example: AUTOACTIVATE_ON_SQL=MicSpkrLogic</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Local
Receiver Section</b> <br>
A local receiver section is used to specify the
configuration for a receiver connected to the sound card. In
the default configuration file there is a Local
configuration section called <b>Rx1</b>. The section name
could be anything. It should match the RX configuration
variable in the logic core where the receiver is to be used.
The available configuration variables are described
below.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AUDIO_DEV</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the audio device to
use. Normally alsa:plughw:0. Have a look at the AUDIO DEVICE
SPECIFICATIONS chapter for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AUDIO_CHANNEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the audio channel to
use. SvxLink can use the left/right stereo channels as two
mono channels. Legal values are 0 or 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_DET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the type of squelch
detector to use. Possible values are: VOX, CTCSS, SERIAL,
EVDEV, SIGLEV, PTY, GPIO or HIDRAW.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The VOX squelch
detector determines if there is a signal present by
calculating a mean value of the sound samples. The VOX
squelch detector behaviour is adjusted with VOX_FILTER_DEPTH
and VOX_THRESH. VOX is actually a bit of a misnomer since
it&rsquo;s a &quot;Voice Operated Squelch&quot; and VOX
actually means &quot;Voice Operated Transmitter&quot;.
However, the term VOX is widely understood by hams all over
the world so we&rsquo;ll stick with it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The CTCSS
squelch detector checks for the presence of a tone with the
specified frequency. The tone frequency is specified using
the CTCSS_FQ config variable. The thresholds are specified
using the CTCSS_OPEN_THRESH and CTCSS_CLOSE_THRESH config
variables. Other config variables that effect the CTCSS
squelch is: CTCSS_MODE, CTCSS_SNR_OFFSET, CTCSS_BPF_LOW,
CTCSS_BPF_HIGH.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The SERIAL
squelch detector use a pin in a serial port to detect if the
squelch is open. This squelch detector can be used if the
receiver have an external hardware indicator of when the
squelch is open. Specify which serial port/pin to use with
SERIAL_PORT and SERIAL_PIN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The EVDEV
squelch detector read squelch events from a
/dev/input/eventX device. An example where this could be
useful is if you have a USB audio device with some buttons
on it. Some of these devices generate key press events, much
like a keyboard. Specify which /dev/input device node to use
using the EVDEV_DEVNAME config variable. Set which events
that should open and close the squelch using the EVDEV_OPEN
and EVDEV_CLOSE config variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The GPIO
squelch detector read a pin on the GPIO Port. Depending on
the level of the pin, the squelch is switched. A HIGH (3.3V)
at the pin set the squelch to open and a LOW (GND) level
will set the squelch to closed. Specify which squelch pin to
use with the GPIO_SQL_PIN configuration variable. On some
devices, like the Orange Pi, you also need to set the
GPIO_PATH configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The SIGLEV
squelch detector use signal level measurements to determine
if the squelch is open or not. Which signal level detector
to use is determined by the setting of the SIGLEV_DET
configuration variable. The open and close thresholds are
set using the SIGLEV_OPEN_THRESH and SIGLEV_CLOSE_THRESH
configuration variables. If using the NOISE signal level
detector note the following. The detector is not perfect
(it&rsquo;s affected by speech) so you will also want to
setup SQL_HANGTIME to prevent it from closing in the middle
of a transmission. A value between 100-300ms is probably
what you need. If using this squelch type in cooperation
with a voter, you&rsquo;ll also probably need to setup
SQL_DELAY to get correct signal level measurements. A value
of about 40ms seem to be OK. Also, when using the NOISE
signal level detector the input audio must be unsquelched
since silence will be interpreted as a high signal
strength.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The PTY squelch
expects a very easy protocol over a pseudo-tty device,
created by SvxLink on runtime. An &rsquo;O&rsquo; over this
pty device indicate an open squelch, a &rsquo;Z&rsquo; is a
closed squelch. Define the slave pty in PTY_PATH (e.g.
PTY_PATH=/tmp/sql) and SvxLink will create a link to the
specified path from it&rsquo;s pseudotty slave device
(/dev/pts/X). This can be used by a script to interface
custom devices, modems or other hardware to SvxLink. Look
for nhrcx.pl to see an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The HIDRAW
squelch supports human interface devices (HID), USB devices
like CM108 soundcard e.g. used in the URI Echolink adapter
made by DMK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_START_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The squelch start delay is of
most use when using VOX squelch. For example, if the
transceiver makes a noise when the transmitter is turned
off, that might trigger the VOX and cause an infinite loop
of squelch open/close transmitter on/off. Specify the number
of milliseconds that the squelch should be &quot;deaf&quot;
after the transmitter has been turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a delay in milliseconds
that a squelch open indication will be delayed. This odd
feature can be of use when using a fast squelch detector in
combination with the signal level detector. A squelch delay
will allow the signal level detector to do its work before
an indication of squelch open is sent to the logic core. A
delay might be needed when using the voter to choose among
multiple receivers. A normal value could be somewhere in
between 20-100ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">How long, in milliseconds, the
squelch will stay open after the detector has indicated that
it is closed. This configuration variable will affect all
squelch detector types.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">At low signal strengths it can
be beneficial to use a longer squelch hangtime so that it is
less likely for the squelch to close. This configuration
variable is unset by default. A value of 1000 milliseconds
may be a good value to start out with. To enable the
extended squelch hangtime feature, set up the
SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME_THRESH variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">At low signal strengths it can
be beneficial to use a longer squelch hangtime so that it is
less likely for the squelch to close. This configuration
variable is unset by default. When set to a signal level it
will activate the extended squelch hangtime feature. When
the signal strength during a transmission fall below the set
threshold, the extended hangtime will be used. Start out
with a value between 10 to 15. The SQL_EXTENDED_HANGTIME
variable is used to set how long the extended squelch
hangtime should be. Make sure that you have calibrated the
signal level detector before turning this feature on.
Otherwise it will not work as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to set an upper limiti, in seconds, for how long the squelch
is allowed to be open. If the timeout value is exceeded the
squelch is forced to closed. If the squelch close for real,
everything is back to normal. When it opens the next time a
squelch open will be signalled. For example, use this
feature to make sure that a faulty receiver cannot block the
system indefinitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>VOX_FILTER_DEPTH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of milliseconds to
create the mean value over. A small value will make the vox
react quicker (&lt;200) and larger values will make it a
little bit more sluggish. A small value is often better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>VOX_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The threshold that the mean
value of the samples must exceed for the squlech to be
considered open. It&rsquo;s hard to say what is a good
value. Something around 1000 is probably a good value. Set
it as low as possible without getting the vox to false
trigger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_MODE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable set
the CTCSS detection method used. These are the ones to
choose from:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="72%">


<p><b>0 (Default)</b> Will choose the detection mode that
is the default in the software. At the moment this is the
&quot;Estimated SNR&quot; mode.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="72%">


<p><b>1 (Neighbour bins)</b> This detection mode will use
three narrow frequency bands (~8Hz) to do the detection. One
band is centered around the tone to be detected and then
there are one band above and one below the tone. These bands
are used to estimate the noise floor. This is the detector
that have been used in SvxLink for a long time. It is
however rather slow with its detection time of about 450ms.
There is no good reason to use this detector anymore but it
is kept in case the new detector does not work for some
hardware setup.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="72%">


<p><b>2 (Estimated SNR)</b> This is a newer detector
implementation which have some improvements. The most
notable difference is that it is faster. The mean detection
time will be around 200ms. This is the default detection
mode if not specified. This detector will use a larger
passband to estimate the noise floor which make it more
stable. The default config use the whole CTCSS passband but
this can be customized using the CTCSS_BPF_LOW and
CTCSS_BPF_HIGH config variables.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="72%">


<p><b>3 (Estimated SNR+Phase)</b> This detector is a bit
experimental. It is even faster and more narrow than the
other detection modes. The mean detection time will be
something like 150ms. The detection bandwidth is very narrow
and very sharp so that no adjacent tones will trigger the
detector. The price to pay for these improvements is that is
it a bit less sensitive.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_FQ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If CTCSS (PL,subtone) squelch
is used (SQL_DET is set to CTCSS), this config variable sets
the frequency of the tone to use. The tone frequency ranges
from 67.0 to 254.1 Hz. There actually is nothing that will
stop you from setting the frequency to something outside
this range but there is no guarantee that it will work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_OPEN_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If CTCSS (PL, subtone) squelch
is used (SQL_DET is set to CTCSS), this config variable sets
the required tone level to indicate squelch open. The value
is some kind of estimated signal to noise dB value. If using
CTCSS mode 2 or 3 it is helpful to set up the
CTCSS_SNR_OFFSET config variable. This will make the SNR
estimation pretty good. Default threshold is 15dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_CLOSE_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If CTCSS (PL, subtone) squelch
is used (SQL_DET is set to CTCSS), this config variable sets
the required tone level to indicate squelch close. The value
is some kind of estimated signal to noise dB value. If using
CTCSS mode 2 or 3 it is helpful to set up the
CTCSS_SNR_OFFSET config variable. This will make the SNR
estimation pretty good. Default threshold is 9dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_SNR_OFFSET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This config variable is used
when CTCSS_MODE is set to 0, 2 or 3. It will adjust the
estimated SNR value so that it becomes very close to a real
SNR value. This value will have to be adjusted if CTCSS_FQ,
CTCSS_MODE, CTCSS_BPF_LOW or CTCSS_BPF_HIGH changes. Use the
siglevdetcal utility to find out what to set this config
variable to. There is no requirement to set this config
variable up. The downside is that you will then need to
experiment more with the CTCSS_OPEN_THRESH and
CTCSS_CLOSE_THRESH config variables to find the correct
squelch level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_BPF_LOW</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When CTCSS_MODE is set to 0, 2
or 3, this config variable will set the low cutoff frequency
for the passband filter. It normally should not have to be
adjusted but could improve the detector if some interference
falls within the passband (e.g. mains hum). Note however
that the more narrow you make the passband, the less stable
the detector will be. You may need to compensate by
increasing the open/close thresholds or by setting up
SQL_DELAY and SQL_HANGTIME. Default is 60Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_BPF_HIGH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When CTCSS_MODE is set to 0, 2
or 3, this config variable will set the high cutoff
frequency for the passband filter. It normally should not
have to be adjusted but could improve the detector if some
interference falls within the passband. Note however that
the more narrow you make the passband, the less stable the
detector will be. You may need to compensate by increasing
the open/close thresholds or by setting up SQL_DELAY and
SQL_HANGTIME. Default is 270Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SERIAL_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If SQL_DET is set to SERIAL,
this config variable determines which serial port should be
used for hardware squelch input (COS - Carrier Operated
Squelch). Note: If the same serial port is used for the PTT,
make sure you specify exactly the same device name.
Otherwise the RX and TX will not be able to share the port.
Example: SQL_PORT=/dev/ttyS0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SERIAL_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If SQL_DET is set to SERIAL,
this config variable determines which pin in the serial port
that should be used for hardware squelch input (COS -
Carrier Operated Squelch). It is possible to use the DCD,
CTS, DSR or RI pin. If inverted operation is desired, prefix
the pin name with an exclamation mark (!).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SQL_PIN=!CTS</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SERIAL_SET_PINS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the specified serial port
pins to a static state. This can be good if using a pin for
reference voltage or if a pin have to be in a certain state
to not interfere with the operation of some equipment. There
are two pins that are possible to use, RTS and DTR. If
prefixed with an exclamation mark (!), the pin will be
cleared and if not it will be set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SERIAL_SET_PINS=RTS!DTR will set RTS and clear DTR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>EVDEV_DEVNAME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify which /dev/input device
node to use for the EVDEV squelch detector. To find out
which device node and event codes to use, install the evtest
utility. Find a candidate device node under /dev/input/ or
/dev/input/by-id/ and try the evtest utility on it. Press
some keys on the device you want to read events from. If
you&rsquo;re in luck, events will be printed on the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>EVDEV_OPEN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the evtest utility, as
described above, to find out type, code and value for the
event you want to use to open the squelch. For example if
type is 1, code is 163 and value is 1, set this config
variable to 1,163,1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>EVDEV_CLOSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the evtest utility, as
described above, to find out type, code and value for the
event you want to use to close the squelch. For example if
type is 1, code is 163 and value is 0, set this config
variable to 1,163,0. If you set the same type,code,value
combination for both EVDEV_OPEN and EVDEV_CLOSE, that event
will toggle the squelch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>GPIO_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to set the path to the sys control devices for GPIO. This
normally is /sys/class/gpio but on some hardware, like the
Orange Pi, the path is /sys/class/gpio_sw.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>GPIO_SQL_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If SQL_DET is set to GPIO this
configuration variable is used to choose which GPIO pin to
use for squelch input. The most common name is
gpio&lt;number&gt;, like gpio4. Some GPIO drivers use more
complex names, like gpio33_pe11. If inverted operation is
desired, prefix the pin name with an exclamation mark
(!).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
GPIO_SQL_PIN=!gpio4</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_DET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Choose which type of signal
level detector to use. The available choices are:
&quot;NONE&quot;, &quot;NOISE&quot;, &quot;TONE&quot; or
&quot;SIM&quot;. Depending on other configuration there may
be more choices available. For example, if a Ddr receiver is
used there will also be a DDR signal level detector
available. The signal level detector is only needed when
using multiple receivers in a voter configuration or when
using the SIGLEV squelch type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Type NONE
disable the signal level detector. This may be used if no
signal level detector is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Type NOISE use
a bandpass filter in the range of 5 - 5.5kHz
(CARD_SAMPLE_RATE &gt;= 16000) or a highpass filter at
3.5kHz (CARD_SAMPLE_RATE = 8000) to estimate the amount of
noise present on the signal. If the passband contain a small
amount of energy, a strong signal is assumed. If the
passband contain more energy, a weaker signal is assumed.
The noise detector must be calibrated for the receiver and
audio levels you use. This is done using the SIGLEV_SLOPE
and SIGLEV_OFFSET configuration variables. See chapter
CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Type TONE is
not really a signal level detector but rather a transport
mechanism for getting signal level measurements from a
remote receiver site, linked in via RF, to the main SvxLink
site. It is using ten tones, one for each signal level step,
in the high audio frequency spektrum (5.5 - 6.4kHz, 100Hz
step) to indicate one of ten signal levels. Only the
receiving part have been implemented in SvxLink at the
moment. On the remote receiver side an Atmel AVR ATmega8 is
used to map the signal level voltage to tone frequencies.
Use the TONE_SIGLEV_MAP configuration variable to map each
tone to a corresponding signal level value in between 0 -
100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Type SIM is a
simulated signal level detector that can be used to debug
problems in the SvxLink software. Use the SIGLEV_MIN,
SIGLEV_MAX, SIGLEV_DEFAULT, SIGLEV_TOGGLE_INTERVAL and
SIGLEV_RAND_INTERVAL configuration variables to configure
the simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HID_DEVICE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter defines the
device your hidraw adapter is connected to. This port is
created by the linux/hidraw driver. e.g.
HID_DEVICE=/dev/hidraw3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HID_SQL_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the pin your hardware
squelch (from RX) is connected to. Valid values are VOL_UP,
VOL_DN, MUTE_PLAY or MUTE_REC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
HID_SQL_PIN=VOL_UP</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_SLOPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The slope (or gain) of the
signal level detector. See chapter CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL
LEVEL DETECTOR below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_OFFSET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The offset of the signal level
detector. See chapter CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR
below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_BOGUS_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable set
an upper threshold for the estimated signal level when using
the noise signal level detector. If the estimation goes over
the given threshold, a signal level of 0 will be reported.
This can be used as a workaround when using a receiver with
squelched audio output. When the squelch is closed, the
receiver audio is silent. The signal level estimator will
interpret this as a very strong signal. Setting up the bogus
signal level threshold will counteract this behavior but a
better solution is to use unsquelched audio if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default this
feature is disabled. If enabling it, start with a value
somewhere around 120.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TONE_SIGLEV_MAP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable is
used to map tones to signal level values when
SIGLEV_DET=TONE. It is a comma separated list of ten values
in the 0 - 100 range. The first value map to the 5500Hz
tone, the second to the 5600Hz tone and so on. The last
value map to the 6400Hz tone. What levels the tones should
be mapped to depends on the tone sender implementation. The
default tone map is 10,20,30...,100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The Atmel AVR
processor used by the author have a reverse mapping so that
the first tone (5500Hz) indicate the highest signal strength
and the last tone (6400Hz) indicate the lowest signal
strength. It is also not linear since it&rsquo;s more
important to have fine measurement granularity in the lower
signal strength range. This is how the mapping look for the
AVR: 100,84,60,50,37,32,28,23,19,8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_OPEN_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the squelch open
threshold for the SIGLEV squelch detector. If using the
NOISE signal level detector, make sure to first calibrate
the signal level detector using the SIGLEV_SLOPE and
SIGLEV_OFFSET configuration variables. The signal level
detector should normally be calibrated so that full signal
strength is 100 and no signal is 0. Depending on your
background noise level a good value for this configuration
variable is between 5 and 20.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_CLOSE_THRESH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the squelch close
threshold for the SIGLEV squelch detector. If using the
NOISE signal level detector, make sure to first calibrate
the signal level detector using the SIGLEV_SLOPE and
SIGLEV_OFFSET configuration variables. The signal level
detector should normally be calibrated so that full signal
strength is 100 and no signal is 0. Depending on your
background noise level a good value for this configuration
variable is between 1 and 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_MIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The minimum signal level used
by SIM signal level detector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_MAX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum signal level used
by SIM signal level detector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_DEFAULT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The default signal level set on
startup by the SIM signal level detector.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_TOGGLE_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The interval, in millisecods,
that the SIM signal level detector will use to toggle
between the maximum and the minimum signal levels.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGLEV_RAND_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The interval, in milliseconds,
that the SIM signal level detector will use between
randomizing a new signal level value. At each interval, the
simulator will randomly either increase or decrease the
signal level with one step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DEEMPHASIS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Apply a deemphasis filter on
received audio. The deemphasis filter is used when taking
audio directly from the detector in the receiver, like when
using a 9k6 packet radio connector. If not using a
deemphasis filter the high frequencies will be amplified
resulting in a very bright (tinny) sound.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_TAIL_ELIM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Squelch tail elimination is
used to remove noise from the end of a received
transmission. This is of most use when using CTCSS or SIGLEV
squelch with unsquelched input audio. A normal value is a
couple of hundred milliseconds. Note that the audio will be
delayed by the same amount of milliseconds. This does not
matter much for a simplex link but for a repeater the delay
might be annoying since you risk hearing the end of your own
transmission.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="78%">


<p>The incoming signal will be amplified by the specified
number of dB. This can be used as a last measure if the
input audio level can&rsquo;t be set high enough on the
analogue side. A value of 6dB will double the signal level.
Note that this is a digital amplification. Hence it will
reduce the dynamic range of the signal so usage should be
avoided if possible. It&rsquo;s always better to correct the
audio level before sampling it.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PEAK_METER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a help to adjust the
incoming audio level. If enabled it will output a message
when distorsion occurs. To adjust the audio level, first
open the squelch. Then increase the audio level until
warning messages are printed. Decrease the audio level until
no warning messages are printed. After the adjustment has
been done, the peak meter can be disabled. 0=disabled,
1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_DEC_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the DTMF decoder type.
Set it to <b>INTERNAL</b> to use the internal software DTMF
decoder. To use the S54S interface featuring a hardware DTMF
decoder, set it to <b>S54S.</b> To control it over a pseudo
tty device set it to <b>PTY.</b> Setting it to PTY will
install the PTY dtmf decoder. SvxLink creates a symlink
linked to a slave pty device on runtime. The name has to be
defined with DTMF_PTY. <b>NONE</b> or commenting it out will
disable DTMF detection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_MUTING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mute the audio during the time
when a DTMF digit is being received. Note that the audio
will be delayed 75ms to give the DTMF detector time to do
its work. This does not matter much on a simplex link but on
a repeater it could be annoying since you will hear the last
75 milliseconds of your own transmission. To counteract the
added delay one can set up the SQL_TAIL_ELIM configuration
variable to at least 75 milliseconds. Legal values for
DTMF_MUTING are 0=disabled, 1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable can
be used if the DTMF decoder is too quick to indicate digit
idle. That does not matter at high signal strengths but for
weaker signals and mobile flutter it&rsquo;s not good at
all. Each DTMF digit will be detected multiple times. Using
this configuration variable, the time (ms) a tone must be
missing to be indicated as off can be extended. Setting this
value too high will cause the decoder to be a bit sluggish
and it might consider two digits as one. The hang time only
affect consecutive digits of the same value (e.g. 1 1). If a
detected digit differs from the previously detected digit
(e.g 1 2), the hang time is immediately canceled and the
detected digit is considered as a new one. A good default
value is 50-100ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_SERIAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When using an external hardware
DTMF decoder this config variable is used to specify a
serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When using the PTY DTMF
&quot;decoder&quot; this configuration variable will set the
path to the PTY slave softlink that the external interface
script use to communicate to SvxLink. Over this symlink a
very easy communication protocol is used to tell SvxLink
received DTMF digits: 0-9, A-F, *, #. &quot;E&quot; is the
same as &quot;*&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is the same as
&quot;#&quot;. Sending a digit tell SvxLink when it starts.
To tell SvxLink that the digit has ended, send a space
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The PTY DTMF
&quot;decoder&quot; can be used by an external script to
interface custom devices, modems or other hardware to
SvxLink. Look for nhrcx.pl to see an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
/tmp/rx1_dtmf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_MAX_FWD_TWIST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">DTMF use two tones to encode
digits 0-9, A-F. These two tones should normally have the
sample amplitude. The difference in amplitude is called
twist. Forward twist is when the higher frequency tone is
lower in amplitude than the lower frequency tone. According
to the standards, 8dB forward twist should be allowed. Some
transmitters do not correctly modulate the DTMF tones to get
zero twist. The most common situation is that the forward
twist is too large. Increasing this configuration variable
above 8dB might allow DTMF from these transmitters to be
detected. When doing this, the DTMF detector will be more
sensitive to noise and might cause more false triggers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_MAX_REV_TWIST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">DTMF use two tones to encode
digits 0-9, A-F. These two tones should normally have the
sample amplitude. The difference in amplitude is called
twist. Reverse twist is when the lower frequency tone is
lower in amplitude than the higher frequency tone. According
to the standards, 4dB reverse twist should be allowed but
SvxLink will allow 6dB by default. The most common reason
for getting reverse twist is a bad de-emphasis filter or
that none at all is used, like when taking audio directly
from the FM discriminator. Have a look at the DEEMPHASIS
configuration variable before starting to modify this
configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_DEBUG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 1 to continuously print
software DTMF decoder decision parameters. This should only
be used for a short while to pinpoint problems with the DTMF
decoding since it will print one row of analysis parameters
100 times per second. The following parameters are
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mute the audio during a call
tone of 1750Hz is received. Note that the audio will be
delayed 75ms to give the tone detector time to do its work.
This does not matter much on a simplex link but on a
repeater it could be annoying since you will hear the last
75 milliseconds of your own transmission. To counteract the
added delay one can set up the SQL_TAIL_ELIM configuration
variable to at least 75 milliseconds. Legal values for
1750_MUTING are 0=disabled, 1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SEL5_TYPE</b></p>

CCIR1, CCIR2, NATEL, EURO, VDEW, AUTO-A, MODAT, PCCIR and
EIA. Only one system can be used at the same time. Please
take into consideration that some Sel5 standards are using
the same or similar tones so it may have some unwanted
effects if you define ZVEI1 for SvxLink and a (e.g.) ZVEI3
sequence is received.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SEL5_DEC_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">At the moment only
SEL5_DEC_TYPE=INTERNAL is valid. Maybe we have support for
some external tone detectors later. To disable SEL5 tone
decoding, specify NONE or just comment the configuration
variable out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RAW_AUDIO_UDP_DEST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Setting this configuration
variable makes it possible to stream the raw audio from the
sound device to an UDP socket. The sample format is the one
used internally in SvxLink, that is each sample is
represented by a 32 bit float. The sample rate is the same
as the one chosen for the audio device. The destination is
specified as ip-address:port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ddr Receiver
Section</b> <br>
A special kind of local receiver is the Digital Drop
Receiver (DDR). It will use either the rtl_tcp utility or a
direct USB connection to interface to a RTL2832U based DVB-T
USB dongle and use that as a wideband receiver. These USB
dongles can be bought cheeply from an Internet shop (~$10).
The radio performance may not be great but better than one
might think. Usage as a cheap local coverage receiver or as
a link receiver may work very well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One big
advantage of using a wideband receiver is that it is
possible to monitor more than one narrow band channel at a
time. The only limit is the CPU power and the bandwidth of
the wideband tuner. You probably need a Pentium4 or better
to fulfill the CPU demands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Getting the
DVB-T dongle running is out of scope for this document but
what you absolutely need to do is to find out the frequency
error on your specific dongle. When you have figured out
what the frequency error is, set up the FQ_CORR
configuration variable in the wideband receiver
configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rtl_tcp
utility is in a package named similar to something like
rtl-sdr. When you have the rtl-sdr stuff installed, just
start rtl_tcp. No command line arguments are needed. Then
configure a Ddr receiver in SvxLink. All configuration
variables that are available for an ordinary local receiver
is also available for a Ddr receiver, except the audio
device related ones which are just ignored. The following
configuration variables are available in addition to the
ordinary ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For a Ddr there also is a
special signal level detector available, DDR, that will
measure the RF power before demodulation. This is much more
reliable than estimating the signal power through the audio
which is normally done in SvxLink. The drawback is that the
Ddr signal level is not completely comparable to the
ordinary SvxLink signal level measurements since it have a
larger dynamic range. Set SIGLEV_DET=DDR to activate the Ddr
signal level detector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Wideband

A wideband receiver section is used to configure access to a
wideband receiver which can be used by a Digital Drop

narrowband channels using the same hardware. The only
hardware supported at the moment is RTL2832U based DVB-T USB
dongles. SvxLink access the dongle directly via USB or

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When using RtlUsb, this
configuration variable is used to select the dongle to use
if there are multiple dongles connected to the computer.
When looking for dongles, SvxLink will try to match the
string given in this configuration variable in different
ways. First, if it&rsquo;s a digit, a match against the
device index is tried. The device index is just a number,
zero and up, that is given to a dongle when it&rsquo;s
inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the device

960000).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FQ_CORR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is probably the most
important configuration variable. Most dongles are far off
in frequency so they need to be calibrated. Calibrating the
dongle can be done in multiple ways. The recommended way is
to use the devcal utility that is distributed along with
SvxLink. The calibration procedure is described in the
devcal (1) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The end result
should be a correction value for how far off the dongle is
in frequency counted in parts per million (PPM). That is,
how many Hz per MHz is the tuner off by. Typical values are
in the range -100 to 100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CENTER_FQ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The frequency, in Hz, that the
wideband tuner should be placed at. This configuration
variable should normally be left unset since SvxLink will
try to place the wideband tuner to cover all set up Ddr
frequencies. SvxLink will also try to avoid placing a Ddr on
the center frequency of the wideband spectrum since there is
usually some noise there. Only use this configuration
variable if you need to override the automatic placement for
some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>XVRTR_OFFSET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a transverter is used, this
configuration variable can be set to the frequency offset
that the transverter introduce. The frequency set here will
be added to the center frequency of the wideband

may mess up the measurements. Finding a good gain setting
may be hard. Too little and you will not hear the signals
you want to hear. Too much and the tuner will be driven into
distorsion. One way to decide the maximum usable gain is to
use the PEAK_METER explained below. When there are no
distorsion warning messages printed or just a single one now
and then you have found the max gain. You should probably
back at least one step down from this value. If the signals
you want to receive are very strong, set the gain as low as
possible.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">What gain
values that are available is tuner dependent. SvxLink will
print the available gain values when it establishes the
connection to the tuner. Typical values are in the range -10
to 50dB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PEAK_METER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If PEAK_METER is set to 1, a
warning will be printed every time the tuner is driven into
distorsion. If it happens too often the gain should be
lowered. At most, one warning per second will be
printed.</p>

SIM_WAVEFORM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the waveform to use;
SIN=sine wave, SQUARE=square wave.</p>

Section</b> <br>
Receiver type &quot;Voter&quot; is a &quot;receiver&quot;
that combines multiple receivers and selects one of them to
take audio from when the squelch opens. Which receiver to
use is selected directly after squelch open. It is possible
to set up a voting delay which will make the voter wait a
while before choosing which RX to use. This will give all
receivers some time to report their signal strengths. After
the initial choice have been made a periodic check is done
to see if any of the other receivers receive a stronger
signal. In the default configuration file there is a voter
section called <b>Voter</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RECEIVERS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a comma separated list
of receivers that the voter should use. Example:
RECEIVERS=Rx1,Rx2,Rx3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>VOTING_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the delay in
milliseconds that the voter will wait after the first
sqeulch open detection until the decision of which receiver
to use is made. This time must be set sufficiently high to
allow all receivers to calculate and report the signal
level. Incoming audio and DTMF digits will be buffered for
all receivers during the delay time so nothing will be lost,
but of course the audio will be delayed the specified amount
of time. This is most noticeble when using a repeater logic.
Use the BUFFER_LENGTH configuration variable to adjust the
buffer length. The default voting delay is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BUFFER_LENGTH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to adjust the length of the voting delay buffer. If not
specified, the buffer length will be the same as the voting
delay. When using the voter with a repeater logic, try to
keep this variable at 0 to reduce the latency. Only increase
it if you feel audio is lost in the beginning of
transmissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>REVOTE_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the interval time in
milliseconds with which the voter will check if another
receiver is receiving a stronger signal. If that is the
case, a receiver switch will be initiated. Default is 1000
milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HYSTERESIS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The hysteresis setting will
prevent the voter from switching back and forth between two
receivers that are equal in signal strength. For a switch to
occur, the other receivers signal strength must exceed the
current receivers signal strength by the percent specified
in this configuration variable. So if the hysteresis is set
to 50% and the received signal strength on the current
receiver is 40, a signal strength of 40*1.5=60 is required
on another receiver to initiate a switch. At squelch open,
if the received signal strength plus hysteresis is larger
than 100, the voting delay will be skipped. The default
hysteresis is 50 percent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RX_SWITCH_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When a receiver switch is
initiated by the voter, it will wait the number of
milliseconds specified in this configuration variable before
actually performing the switch. The switch will only occur
if the other receivers signal strength is still higher.
Default is 500 milliseconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SQL_CLOSE_REVOTE_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The voter will wait the number
of milliseconds specified in this config variable after a
squelch close before voting in another receiver. There are
two reasons for using this delay. The first is to prevent
the voter from going into idle state immediately when the
squelch close for a fluttery signal. If it goes to idle, the
procedure with voting delay may cause longer dropouts than
necessary. The second reason to use this config variable is
if different receivers have different hang times (explicitly
or implicitly). If both a slow and fast receiver is
receiving the same signal and the faster is currently
chosen, when the PTT is released the slower receiver will be
voted before closing. This will cause a double squelch tail
and double roger beep. Default is 500 milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>COMMAND_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the path to a PTY that
can be used to control the voter from the operating system.

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set this configuration variable
to 1 to suppress logging of multiple disconnect messages in
a row, like when there is no RemoteTrx running on the other
side. Thus, failed reconnect attempts will not be logged at
all. This may be of use if a RemoteTrx is missing for a long
time or if it&rsquo;s only used from time to time. The
default is 0 which means that all reconnect attempts will be
logged.</p>

(password) to use to connect to the RemoteTrx server. The
same key have to be specified in the RemoteTrx
configuration. If no key is specified in the RemoteTrx
config, the login will be unauthenticated. A good
authentication key should be 20 characters long. If the same
RemoteTrx is used for both RX and TX, the same key must be
specified in the RX as well as in the TX configuration
section. The key will never be transmitted over the network.
A HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response procedure will be used for
authentication.</p>

and it also have the best quality for a given bitrate.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_FRAMES_PER_PACKET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Each
Speex frame contains 20ms audio. If using a low bitrate
configuration, the network overhead will be quite noticeable
if sending each frame in its own packet. One way to lower
the overhead is to send multiple frames in each network
packet. The drawback with doing this is that you get more
delay. If setting this option to something like 4 (default),
the delay will be about 4x20=80ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_QUALITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the encoder quality using a number between 0-10. Lower
values give poorer quality and lower bitrates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the bitrate to use. Speex will snap to the nearest lower
possible bitrate. Possible values range from 2150 to 24600
bps. You should probably not specify quality at the same
time as bitrate. Not sure though...</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. The difference in
SNR between the lowest and highest value is about 2dB. Set
it as high as possible without overloading the CPU on the
encoding computer (check CPU usage using command
&quot;top&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) variable bitrate encoding. If enabled,
the encoder will try to keep a constant quality by

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_ABR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. The
average bitrate encoding will try to keep a target bitrate
by continuously adjusting the quality. This configuration
variable specify the target bitrate and enable ABR. It also
need to have VBR enabled so don&rsquo;t force it to off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_DEC_ENHANCER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex decoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) the perceptual enhancer in the decoder.
Perceptual enhancement is a part of the decoder which, when
turned on, attempts to reduce the perception of the
noise/distortion produced by the encoding/decoding process.
In most cases, perceptual enhancement brings the sound
further from the original objectively (e.g. considering only
SNR), but in the end it still sounds better (subjective
improvement).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_FRAME_SIZE</b></p>

how large, in milliseconds, each audio packet should be.
Default: 20ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Opus encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. Set it as high as
possible without overloading the CPU on the encoding
computer (check CPU usage using command &quot;top&quot;).
Default: 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Opus encoder setting. This is
the bitrate that the encoder will encode for. Rates from
about 8000 to 64000 bits per second are meaningful but the
codec can handle from like 2500 to 512000 bps. Default:
20000bps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Opus encoder setting. Enable

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AUDIO_DEV</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the audio device to
use. Normally alsa:plughw:0. Have a look at the AUDIO DEVICE
SPECIFICATIONS chapter for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AUDIO_CHANNEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the audio channel to
use. SvxLink can use the left/right stereo channels as two
mono channels. Legal values are 0 or 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PTT_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to specify which type of hardware to use to control the PTT.
Specify &quot;SerialPin&quot; for using a pin in the serial
port, &quot;GPIO&quot; to use a pin in a GPIO port,
&quot;PTY&quot; if you want to use an external interface
script via a pseudo tty port or &quot;Hidraw&quot; to use
the linux/hidraw driver to support hidraw devices like CM108
sound card, e.g. URI device from DMK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Set PTT_TYPE to
&quot;Dummy&quot; or &quot;NONE&quot; to not use any PTT
hardware at all. It is an error to not specify PTT_TYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Use PTT_PIN to
specify the pin to use for &quot;SerialPin&quot; or
&quot;GPIO&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PTT_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the serial port that
the PTT is connected to. E.g. /dev/ttyS0 for COM1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PTT_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If PTT_TYPE is set to
&quot;SerialPin&quot;, specify the pin(s) in the serial port
that the PTT is connected to. It is possible to specify one
or two serial port pins. Some interface boards require that
you specify two pins since one pin does not provide enough
drive power to the circuit. A &quot;!&quot; in front of the
pin name indicates inverted operation. Some of the possible
values are RTS, DTRRTS, !DTR!RTS or even DTR!RTS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If GPIO was
specified in PTT_TYPE, set the PTT_PIN config variable to
the pin name of the GPIO-pin to use. The most common name is
gpio&lt;number&gt;, like gpio3. Some GPIO drivers use more
complex pin names like gpio33_pe11. Have a look at the USING
GPIO section for information on how to set up the operating
system. Normally, the pin will be active high but if the pin
name is prefixed with an exclamation mark it will be active
low instead. For some hardware platforms you may need to
also set the GPIO_PATH configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>GPIO_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to set the path to the sys control devices for GPIO. This
normally is /sys/class/gpio but on some hardware, like the
Orange Pi, the path is /sys/class/gpio_sw.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PTT_PTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If PTT_TYPE is set to
&quot;PTY&quot; this configuration variable will set the
path for the PTY slave softlink that is used by the external
script to communicate to SvxLink.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">SvxLink sends a
&rsquo;T&rsquo; to start transmitting and a &rsquo;R&rsquo;
to turn the transmitter off. This can be used by an external
script to interface custom devices, modems or other hardware
to SvxLink. Look for nhrcx.pl to see an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HID_DEVICE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the device node where
your hidraw device is accessible at.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
HID_DEVICE=/dev/hidraw3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HID_PTT_PIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the pin your ptt control
is connected to. Valid parameters are are
GPIO1,GPIO2,GPIO3,GPIO4. Note that some sound cards like
SSS1621 may not support GPIO3 and GPIO4! You can invert the
behaviour with a &quot;!&quot; in front of the name. Only
one value is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SERIAL_SET_PINS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the specified serial port
pins to a static state. This can be good if using a pin for
reference voltage or if a pin have to be in a certain state
to not interfere with the operation of some equipment. There
are two pins that are possible to use, RTS and DTR. If
prefixed with an exclamation mark (!), the pin will be
cleared and if not it will be set. This configuration
variable can only be used when PTT_TYPE is set to
&quot;SerialPin&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
SERIAL_SET_PINS=RTS!DTR will set RTS and clear DTR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PTT_HANGTIME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this configuration variable
to set a PTT hangtime. This can be good to have on a
transmitter in combination with using a tone squelch. When
the transmitter is ordered to stop transmitting, the tone is
immediately turned off, causing the squelch to close on the
other side. Since the transmitter keeps transmitting for a
while, no squelch tail will be heard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Another use is
on a remote receiver link transmitter where you don&rsquo;t
want the transmitter to turn on and off between
transmissions or if the squelch close and open quickly due
to for example mobile flutter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a feature that will
prevent the transmitter from getting stuck transmitting.
Specify the number of seconds before the transmitter is
turned off. Note that this is a low level security mechanism
that is meant to only kick in if there is a software bug in
SvxLink. Just so that the transmitter will not transmit
indefinately. It is not meant to be used to keep people from
talking too long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TX_DELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of milliseconds
(0-1000) to wait after the transmitter has been turned on
until audio is starting to be transmitted. This can be used
to compensate for slow TX reaction or remote stations with
slow reacting squelches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_FQ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The frequency in Hz of the
CTCSS tone to transmit. It is possible to specify fractions
using &quot;.&quot; as decimal comma (e.g. 136.5). For the
tone to be transmitted the CTCSS_LEVEL variable must also be
setup and also the TX_CTCSS variable in the logic core
configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CTCSS_LEVEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The level in percent (0-100) of
the CTCSS tone to transmit. What level to set is hard to
say. The FM modulation swing of the tone should be in
between 500-800 Hz. That is a bit hard to measure if you
don&rsquo;t have the right equipment. A normal FM station
have a maximum swing of 5kHz so if you manage to calibrate
everything so that you get maximum swing when the sound card
audio is at peak level, the tone level should be in between
10-16%. However, most often the audio settings are
configured a bit higher than max since the audio seldom
reaches maximum level. Then the level of the CTCSS tone
should be reduced. The default in the configuration file is
9%. For the tone to be transmitted the CTCSS_FQ variable
must also be setup and also the TX_CTCSS variable in the
logic core configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PREEMPHASIS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">[EXPERIMENTAL] Enable this
feature if you are modulating the FM modulator directly,
like through a 9k6 packet radio input. If no preemphasis
filter is applied to the audio, it will sound very dark when
received. If you modulate the transmitter through the
microphone input the radio will apply a preemphasis filter
so this feature should be disabled. 0=disabled,
1=enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_TONE_LENGTH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The duration, in milliseconds,
of DTMF digits transmitted on this transmitter. 100ms is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_TONE_SPACING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The spacing, in milliseconds,
between DTMF digits transmitted on this transmitter. 50ms is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DTMF_DIGIT_PWR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The power, in dB, of DTMF
digits transmitted on this transmitter. Zero dB will give
the same power in the generated signal as there is in a
maximum amplitude (full scale) sine wave. &minus;15dB is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TONE_SIGLEV_MAP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">It is possible to transmit one
of ten tones along with the normal transmission to indicate
a signal strength value to the receiver. This is of most use
when using a local transmitter as a link transmitter in a
RemoteTrx. It is not implemented, and probably not useful,
in SvxLink Server. Another requirement is that SvxLink has
been compiled in 16kHz mode. Otherwise this feature is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
TONE_SIGLEV_MAP configuration variable is used to map tones
to signal level values. It is a comma separated list of
exactly ten values in the 0 - 100 range. The first value map
to the 5500Hz tone, the second to the 5600Hz tone and so on.
The last value map to the 6400Hz tone. What levels the tones
should be mapped to depends on the tone receiver
implementation. Typically, if using a SvxLink application as
a receiver, the TONE_SIGLEV_MAP should be the same in the RX
configuration for that node.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TONE_SIGLEV_LEVEL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">It is possible to transmit one
of ten tones along with the normal transmission to indicate
a signal strength value to the receiver. This is of most use
when using a local transmitter as a link transmitter in a
RemoteTrx. It is not implemented, and probably not useful,
in SvxLink Server. Another requirement is that SvxLink has
been compiled in 16kHz mode. Otherwise this feature is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
TONE_SIGLEV_LEVEL configuration variable is used to set the
tone level. It is a value in the 1-100 range which indicate
the output level in percent of the maximum possible level.
The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MASTER_GAIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This configuration variable can
be used to fine tune or increase the audio gain for all
transmitted sound if it&rsquo;s not possible to do using the
normal sound card hardware gain controls. The gain should be
given in dB and can be both positive and negative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Networked
Transmitter Section</b> <br>
A networked transmitter section is used to specify the
configuration for a transmitter connected through a TCP/IP
network. In the default configuration file there is a
networked transceiver configuration section called
<b>NetTx</b>. The section name could be anything. It should
match the TX configuration variable in the logic core where
the transmitter is to be used. The available configuration
variables are described below. How to use a networked
transmitter is further described in the <b>remotetrx</b>(1)
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TCP_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The TCP port that RemoteTrx
listen on. The default is 5210.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LOG_DISCONNECTS_ONCE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set this configuration variable
to 1 to suppress logging of multiple disconnect messages in
a row, like when there is no RemoteTrx running on the other
side. Thus, failed reconnect attempts will not be logged at
all. This may be of use if a RemoteTrx is missing for a long
time or if it&rsquo;s only used from time to time. The
default is 0 which means that all reconnect attempts will be
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AUTH_KEY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the authentication key
(password) to use to connect to the RemoteTrx server. The
same key have to be specified in the RemoteTrx
configuration. If no key is specified in the RemoteTrx
config, the login will be unauthenticated. A good
authentication key should be 20 characters long. If the same
RemoteTrx is used for both RX and TX, the same key must be
specified in the RX as well as in the TX configuration
section. The key will never be transmitted over the network.
A HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response procedure will be used for
authentication.</p>

<p><b>CODEC</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>

<p>The audio codec to use when transferring audio to this
remote transmitter. Available codecs are: RAW (512kbps), S16
(256kbps), GSM (13.2kbps), SPEEX (8-25kbps), OPUS
(8-64kbps). These are raw bitrate values. There will be some
overhead added to this so the real bitrates on the wire are
a little bit higher. The OPUS codec is the most modern one
and it also have the best quality for a given bitrate. There
also is a NULL codec that will just throw away samples which
can be used in special situations when the audio is sent
through another audio path.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_FRAMES_PER_PACKET</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Each
Speex frame contains 20ms audio. If using a low bitrate
configuration, the network overhead will be quite noticeable
if sending each frame in its own packet. One way to lower
the overhead is to send multiple frames in each network
packet. The drawback with doing this is that you get more
delay. If setting this option to something like 4 (default),
the delay will be about 4x20=80ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_QUALITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the encoder quality using a number between 0-10. Lower
values give poorer quality and lower bitrates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Specify
the bitrate to use. Speex will snap to the nearest lower
possible bitrate. Possible values range from 2150 to 24600
bps. You should probably not specify quality at the same
time as bitrate. Not sure though...</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. The difference in
SNR between the lowest and highest value is about 2dB. Set
it as high as possible without overloading the CPU on the
encoding computer (check CPU usage using command
&quot;top&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) variable bitrate encoding. If enabled,
the encoder will try to keep a constant quality by
increasing the bitrate when needed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_VBR_QUALITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. The
quality (0-10) to use in variable bitrate mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_ENC_ABR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex encoder setting. The
average bitrate encoding will try to keep a target bitrate
by continuously adjusting the quality. This configuration
variable specify the target bitrate and enable ABR. It also
need to have VBR enabled so don&rsquo;t force it to off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPEEX_DEC_ENHANCER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Speex decoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) the perceptual enhancer in the decoder.
Perceptual enhancement is a part of the decoder which, when
turned on, attempts to reduce the perception of the
noise/distortion produced by the encoding/decoding process.
In most cases, perceptual enhancement brings the sound
further from the original objectively (e.g. considering only
SNR), but in the end it still sounds better (subjective
improvement).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_FRAME_SIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Opus encoder setting. Specify
how large, in milliseconds, each audio packet should be.
Default: 20ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_COMPLEXITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Opus encoder setting. The
complexity setting (0-10) tells the encoder how much CPU
time it should spend on doing a good job. Set it as high as
possible without overloading the CPU on the encoding
computer (check CPU usage using command &quot;top&quot;).
Default: 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_BITRATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Opus encoder setting. This is
the bitrate that the encoder will encode for. Rates from
about 8000 to 64000 bits per second are meaningful but the
codec can handle from like 2500 to 512000 bps. Default:
20000bps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OPUS_ENC_VBR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Opus encoder setting. Enable
(1) or disable (0) variable bitrate encoding. If enabled,
the encoder will try to keep a constant quality by
increasing the bitrate when needed and decrease it when the
quality can be assured with a lower bitrate. The target
average bitrate is the one set by OPUS_ENC_BITRATE. Default:
1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Multi
Transmitter Section</b> <br>
A multi transmitter section is used if one wants to transmit
on multiple transmitters simulaneously. The name of the
section can be anything. Just point it out from another

APRS digipeater. In some cases it has to be changed
according to local requirements. Please contact your local
APRS sysop for further information. Changes should be made
only according to the NEWn-N paradigm. Leave this variable
untouched if you are unsure of its setting. No spaces or
control characters are allowed. PATH has no influence on the
propagation on non-RF networks.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BEACON_INTERVAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The interval, in minutes, with
which beacons will be sent to the APRS network. A good value
is 10 minutes. If your beacon is gated via RF, please
increase the interval a bit to keep the APRS traffic on RF
produced by the APRS RF gate as low as possible. Intervals
shorter than 10 minutes will be changed to 10.</p>

<h2>AUDIO DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS
<a name="AUDIO DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The AUDIO_DEV
configuration variables specify which audio device to use
for a receiver or transmitter. SvxLink support a number of
different audio input and output devices. The format of the
configuration variable is &quot;type:dev_spec&quot;. There
are three different types of audio devices supported,
&quot;alsa&quot;, &quot;oss&quot; and &quot;udp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;alsa&quot; type will use the specified Alsa device.
Example: &quot;alsa:plughw:0&quot;. Describing the format of
Alsa device names is outside the scope for this
document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;oss&quot; type will use the specified OSS audio
device. Example &quot;oss:/dev/dsp&quot;. OSS is the old
sound system used by Linux. Alsa should be used when
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;udp&quot; type is not really an audio device but
instead will read and write audio from/to a UDP socket. This
can be used to interface SvxLink to all sorts of audio
sources/sinks capable of streaming raw audio through UDP.
One example usage is to interface SvxLink with GNU Radio.
Example: &quot;udp:127.0.0.1:10000&quot;. Note however that
the only supported format is raw 16 bit signed samples, two
interleved channels. Sampling frequency can be chosen using
the CARD_SAMPLE_RATE config variable as usual.</p>

<h2>USING GPIO
<a name="USING GPIO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GPIO (General
Purpose IO) is used to access hardware pins that are made
available for example on an embedded system. Before starting
to use a pin in SvxLink some setup need to be done in the
operating system. With the standard distribution of SvxLink
there is a pair of scripts that help with setting up and
taking down the GPIO pins. The scripts are named
svxlink_gpio_up and svxlink_gpio_down. The configuration
file, which can be found among the other SvxLink
configuration files (typically in /etc/svxlink), is called
gpio.conf.</p>

<h2>CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR
<a name="CALIBRATING THE SIGNAL LEVEL DETECTOR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The signal
level detector is used when using multiple receivers or when
using the SIGLEV squelch. The signal level is used by a
voter to choose the receiver with the highest signal
strength. The choice is made directly after squelch open.
For the voter to make a correct choice, the signal level
detector must be calibrated on each receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use the
noise signal level detector, first set SIGLEV_DET=NOISE.
There are two configuration variables that is used to
calibrate the detector. They are SIGLEV_SLOPE and
SIGLEV_OFFSET in a local receiver section. The slope is the
gain of the detector and the offset is used to adjust the
detector so that when there is no input signal, the detector
will return 0. The goal is to adjust the detector so that
when no signal is received, a value of 0 is produced and
when full signal strength is received, a value of 100 is
produced. It will never be exakt but that does not
matter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The calibration
is normally done by using the <b>siglevdetcal</b>(1)
application. To be able to do a correct calibration, it must
be possible to open the squelch so that only noise is
received. The antenna cable should be disconnected or a
dummy load should be used. <b>WARNING:</b> Before starting
the siglevdetcal application, pull the PTT cable since the
PTT might get triggered during the calibration
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
siglevdetcal utility will also measure the CTCSS tone SNR
offset so that the CTCSS_SNR_OFFSET config variable can be
set up to a proper value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
siglevdetcal application cannot be used for some reason, the
manual procedure below might be used. This procedure will
only work for a receiver with unsquelched audio.
<b>Note:</b> To calibrate a remote receiver it must be
connected to the SvxLink server. Otherwise the squelch will
not open.</p>
